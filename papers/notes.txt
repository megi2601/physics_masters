- zgłębienie random matrix theory (coś konkretnego zamiast symulacji, poprawność symulacji, istotność stałej macierzy korelacji etc)
- clustrowanie macierzy korelacji - metody, interpretacja etc
- indeksy w 'sektorach' C (np tylko banki) - powinno wyjść ze korelacje są większe

abstract prompt:
Facts:
*investors try to predict future market movements to get ahead, maximize gain and minimize risk
*correlations play crucial role in constructing diversified portfolio

Current knowledge:
* there is 'leverage effect': decline in price of an asset is associated with increased future realised volatility 
* this is not the whole story: for an index, its volatility is greater than averaged volatility of its components, because correlations between assets also contribute 


Idea+Methods:
* take daily data from polish stock market from 2010-2024 (prices of stocks)
* construct a simple index by averaging prices 
* regres index volatility, average stock volatility and average correlations between stock on parameter: previous value of index return (analyse for different time lags between 1 and 200 days)
* examine how avg stock volatility and avg corr contribute to total index volatility
* check if regression on standard index WIG gives more or less predictive power 
* move on to correlations: use principal regression analysis (I will insert an equation) to examine correlations as a time and time lag dependent matrix, not just stationary
*analyse eigenvalues and eigenvectors of prev index return dependent "corr matrix" to examine market movements 

Results:
* so far I see that polish stock exchange behaves differently than american stock exchange, correlations are lower but still significant

Impact:
*good to know how these studied things are behaving on polish stock market
*one can devise more sophisticated methods tailored for polish after examining the basics


volatility -> fluctuations
portfolio -> only risk management
are followed -> towarzyszą 

still influential NEGATIVE correlations

sama volatility powinna mieć długą autokorelacje
